# Switch the Catalyst MCP Data Center

Use this skill when a Codex user needs to select or change the regional Catalyst MCP endpoint.

## Safety Rules

- Catalyst MCP endpoints are region-specific for compliance. Never infer a DC from the user's location, project name, previous session, or available account data.
- Require the user to explicitly choose one of: `US`, `EU`, `IN`, `AU`, `CA`, `SA`, `JP`, `UAE`.
- Show the exact endpoint before applying the change.
- Do not edit the installed plugin's `.mcp.json`; it is managed plugin content.
- Do not edit OAuth credentials.
- After changing the configuration, do not use the old Catalyst MCP connection. Connect to the selected DC's regional server before any further `ZohoMCP_*` calls.

## Procedure

1. If the user did not specify a supported DC, ask them to choose one. Do not select a default.
2. State the matching endpoint from this table and ask for confirmation if the user's request did not already explicitly authorize the switch:

   | DC | Endpoint |
   |----|----------|
   | US | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.com/mcp/message` |
   | EU | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.eu/mcp/message` |
   | IN | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.in/mcp/message` |
   | AU | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.com.au/mcp/message` |
   | CA | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.ca/mcp/message` |
   | SA | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.sa/mcp/message` |
   | JP | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.jp/mcp/message` |
   | UAE | `https://catalyst.zohomcp.ae/mcp/message` |

3. Run `codex plugin list --json` and find the enabled entry whose `name` is `catalyst-by-zoho`. Use its `source.path` as `<installed-plugin-path>` and its `pluginId` as `<plugin-id>`. If more than one enabled entry matches, ask which installation to configure.
4. Run the bundled helper with permission to update the user-level Codex configuration:

   ```bash
   node "<installed-plugin-path>/scripts/switch-dc.js" <DC>
   ```

   The helper:
   - discovers the installed plugin ID using `codex plugin list --json`;
   - updates only `plugins.<plugin-id>.mcp_servers.<regional-server>.enabled` in `~/.codex/config.toml`;
   - disables every other Catalyst regional server;
   - preserves unrelated settings and creates `config.toml.catalyst-dc.bak`;
   - writes the result atomically.

5. If multiple enabled Catalyst plugin installations are reported, ask the user which installation to configure, then rerun:

   ```bash
   node "<installed-plugin-path>/scripts/switch-dc.js" <DC> --plugin-id "<plugin-id>"
   ```

6. Check the selection with `node "<installed-plugin-path>/scripts/switch-dc.js" --status --plugin-id "<plugin-id>"`. Confirm that exactly the selected regional server (`catalyst-<dc-in-lowercase>`) is enabled.
7. Connect to `catalyst-<dc-in-lowercase>` in Codex's MCP server controls, completing the browser OAuth flow for the selected endpoint if prompted. If the agent cannot connect the server directly, ask the user to connect that named server and wait for confirmation. Do not use a still-active connection to the previous DC.
8. Once connected, confirm that the `ZohoMCP_*` meta-tools are available from the selected server before performing Catalyst MCP operations. If the connection cannot be verified in this session, stop and report the blocker; do not fall back to the old connection. Report the selected DC and endpoint. A Codex restart is not required.

## Check Current Selection

```bash
node "<installed-plugin-path>/scripts/switch-dc.js" --status
```

The status command exits successfully only when exactly one Catalyst regional server is enabled.
